			<dt>  Some changes that I made during my phases of development of this website are explained below:</dt>
				<dd> <ul>
						<li> The background and the theme of the website. I knew that design plays as a vital role in the website. 
							Design and Theme acts as the trademark of the website. For example for facebook the color blue is its trademark and for 
							red header with white background makes us know that its a youtube. So, to make my website unique and attractive I changed my
							theme of the website.
						</li>
						<li> I changed my navigation bar from top to left side of the website. I did this because I had an effective and better concept
							about how my website should look like.
						</li>
						<li> I also changed my website because my purpose of designing my website changed from not just doing my assignment but also
						learning new skill for my future career. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</dd>

		<p> Among three web host I will choose and recommend to choose Bluehost. It is because the offer that is given by this 
		host at this price is very economic to all the user. So, I recommend Bluehost to be the best.</p>
