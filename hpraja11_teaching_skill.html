	<p>I don't remember when I started to get interested in teaching but I know how I grew interest in this thing.
	When i passed my school during that time i had a 3 months of gaps so inorder to utilize that time i started to teach maths and science. There were only 2 students when i started my teaching 
     from that time i was interested in teaching. I used to teach about 2 hours regarding their subject and the students were also freindly and they love the way i teach.
     Everytime i dont teach the student sometimes they feel bored so i used to tell some jokes inorder to make them entertain.
     Not only that i used to make them watch some videos regarding their subject because watching the videos also helps them to get some ideas regarding the subjects.
     As practical knowledge is better than theoretical knowledge. So, teaching is also one of my skill.  </p>
