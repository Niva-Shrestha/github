		<h3> Web Skill </h3>
			
			Among several skills that I have web skill is also one of them.I have a good understanding about the web development from my school time.By using HTML we were 
   taught to make a simple webpage.Also in high school i had a project regarding making a webpage 
   design for the college.Similarly, i have also knowledge regarding the QBASIC programming langauge.After I came to Australia to study IT, I made this website as a part of assignment. 
			During the development of this webpage I did many changes step by step. In every step of development, the website became more attractive. 
			I made some drastic change in some stage and some minor changes in some stage.
			There are some issues that I faced so I had had to change the website I have included these issues
			below and some skill in designing sign up form as listed below:
